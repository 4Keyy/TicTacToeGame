// * The simplest tic-tac-toe game.
/// * Written by - 4Keyy. Repository on GitHub - https://github.com/4Keyy/TicTacToeGame
/// * The code is written in the Visual Studio program, therefore it has third-party files for the program to work correctly in Visual Studio
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- //
// My first project, which was written by myselfand fully commented out.
// The project was written with practically minimal knowledge of the language, and was created for its practiceand study. As the project is written, the skill of writing the code will change.
// Tasks to the project: not only a working program, but also the maximum absence of bad code.

// * Connect all the necessary libraries
#include <iostream> // Standard library for working with C ++ console
#include <string> // Library for working with string variables
#include <stdio.h> // Standard library for working with the C console
#include <Windows.h> // Library for working with Windows OC files
#include <time.h> // Library for working with time

// Connecting the required namespace
using namespace std;

// Creating global variables
char[9]{ '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-' };

// Main function
void main()
{
	// Write this for normal work with Cyrillic in the console
	setlocale(0, "");

	// Write this to make the main function work nicely.
	system("pause");
	system("cls");
